# What is Itsachat
Itsachat is a Python project built as part of a take home challenge. It consists of a Python webserver and a webclient which communicate using websockets.

# Why is it on GitHub
This project is on GitHub mostly for archival purposes. I figured that it would be a more natural fit than keeping a ZIP file somewhere.

# What is the future of this project
There is none, I do not intend to develop it further.

# How to build and run it
I honestly don't remember. In my defense I haven't written any Python before or since getting this assignment as I ended up being offered a different position elsewhere.

## Dependencies
Itsachat depends on the following libraries:
- aiohttp
- socketio
